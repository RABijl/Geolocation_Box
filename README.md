# Geolocation_Box

The result of a personal hobby, the geolocation box is a little arduino powered chest that only opens when one brings the box the right geological location. A little screen on top of it indicates how far one is from the location.

## Parts list
The parts have been bought from local Dutch websites, but should also easily be available in international markets.
